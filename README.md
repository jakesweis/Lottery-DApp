# Lottery App
The purpose of this app was to create a "lottery" defi app where users can buy tickets in different lotteries and hope they get chosen to claim the winning prize of the lottery which was supposed to use psedo-randomness to pick a winner (I could not get this part to work as I found out Solana does not allow for randomness easily).

My lottery app/instructions are currently deployed to devnet at address `HvJymJvJKu1REDZ4Jr6HrzSDNMpTZXsh48PGmjAGa3TS`.
